# Contributing to HighBoy Firmware

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HighBoy! We welcome contributions from everyone. This document provides guidelines and instructions to help you get started.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository and its submodules recursively to ensure you have all dependencies:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HighCodeh/TentacleOS.git
cd TentacleOS
```

### 2. Prerequisites
This project is built using the **Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF)**.

- **Required Version:** ESP-IDF v5.3 or later (Check the latest stable version).
- **Setup Guide:** Follow the [Official ESP-IDF Installation Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html).

Ensure your environment is set up:
```bash
. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
```

### 3. Compiling
The project supports multiple hardware targets. Navigate to the specific firmware directory for your target:

#### ESP32-C5
```bash
cd firmware_c5
idf.py set-target esp32c5
idf.py build
```

#### ESP32-P4
```bash
cd firmware_p4
idf.py set-target esp32p4
idf.py build
```

*(Note: In the `/tools` directory, there is a `.sh` file responsible for automatic building and flashing.)*

## Development Workflow

### Coding Style & Conventions
We follow the [ESP-IDF Style Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/contribute/style-guide.html) with the following specific conventions:

#### 1. Naming Conventions
- **Files:** Use `snake_case.c` and `snake_case.h`.
- **Functions:** Use `snake_case` (e.g., `subghz_receiver_start`).
- **Variables:** Use `snake_case` (e.g., `decoded_data`).
- **Types (Structs/Enums):** Use `snake_case_t` suffix (e.g., `subghz_data_t`).
- **Macros & Constants:** Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `RMT_RESOLUTION_HZ`).

#### 2. Code Structure
- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces (preferred) or 2 spaces if consistent with the existing file.
- **Include Guards:** All headers must use `#ifndef FILENAME_H` guards.
- **C++ Compatibility:** Header files should include the `extern "C"` block for C++ compatibility.
- **License Header:** New files should include the Apache 2.0 license header at the top.

#### 3. Logging & Error Handling
- **Tags:** Define a `static const char *TAG = "MODULE_NAME";` at the top of `.c` files.
- **Logging:** Use `ESP_LOGI`, `ESP_LOGW`, `ESP_LOGE`, and `ESP_LOGD` for system output.
- **Errors:** Use `ESP_ERROR_CHECK()` for critical initialization steps.

#### 4. Documentation
- Use Doxygen-style comments (`/** ... */`) in header files to document public APIs and structures.
- All comments and documentation must be in **English**.

### Commit Conventions
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This helps in generating changelogs and understanding the history.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`.

Example: `feat(subghz): add waterfall visualization`

---

## Continuous Integration (CI)
We use **GitHub Actions** to automatically build the project for all supported targets upon every push and Pull Request.

- **Status Checks:** All CI builds must pass before a Pull Request can be merged.
- **Blocked Merges:** If any build fails, the merge will be blocked until the issues are resolved.

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Branch:** Create a feature or bugfix branch from `dev` or `main`.
2. **Commit Changes:** Use conventional commit messages.
3. **Verify Build:** Ensure the project compiles locally for your target.
4. **Push & PR:** Push to your fork and create a Pull Request against the `dev` branch.
5. **CI Validation:** Wait for GitHub Actions to complete the build verification.
6. **Review:** At least one maintainer must review and approve your PR before merging.
